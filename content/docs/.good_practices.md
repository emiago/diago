## RTP stream cuts

When RTP stream cuts happen, it may cause some high Jitter detection in system, or even your provider 
could terminate call if this cuts are long. 

Solution: RTP Comfort Noise, Silence Playing

## Buggy SIP UAC

Either due to NAT or buggy SIP clients, often you can have bad call termination (missing BYE) and therefore
this calls could stay long in your system and producing large costs. 

Solution: **RTP Timeout**, where this timer will cause Dialog SIP termination

## Dealing with NAT

### Contact header

Contact header in dialog makes big deal, as it is used for remote side to sent subsequent requests like BYE.
In many cases when behind NAT, this value actually is not useful, and your service needs to be aware of. 

Solutions: Service does Contact Rewrite internally with source address of initial request/response

### NAT Keep alive 

NAT ports can be closed so keeping them alive is nessessary. 
Consider having in place:
- SIP Keep alive
- RTP Keep alive
