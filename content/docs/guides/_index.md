Understanding VOIP can be a challenge for newcomers, but can it be simple and easier approach?

VOIP is now mostly built with SIP. SIP is textual protocol same as HTTP so if you know HTTP reading 
SIP messages will be easy.
It acts similar and has similar behavior (request/response) but focus is more on Session. 
With realtime media like audio/video there is always session after which it ends. Creating, Updating, Clossing
this Session is something that SIP is designed

Here I will try to provide some simple documentation to help you **BUILDERS**.
