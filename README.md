# Diago

Short of **dialog + GO**.  
Framework for building comunication (VOIP) solutions in GO. 

It is providing more developer friendly solution on top of [SIPgo](https://github.com/emiago/sipgo) with **media** stack integrations. 


**Library is here shared only partially with some core features. If you want to get extended version with more features, support or consulting checkout**  [Support section](#support)**

Stack: 
- Signaling: SIP
- Media: RTP/UDP, Webrtc

**NOTE: This API design is WIP and no PRs are accepted, but issues or feature requests are welcome**

# Why it exists

Due to experience development of VOIP services is slow or it was full workarrounds. Lot of this needs to be maintained or extended in low level languages  or as alternative you need to build services arround frameworks like Asterisk. Of course second approach adds scalling problem. 
Nowdays also there is requirement to also deal more closely with media(audio) so the more abstractions you have, maintance and arhitecture becomes complext.

Diago is build with GO language and we are keeping well optimized sip and media stack to have performance and low GC latency. Major win is Go offers fast development speed and memory safety.


# Getting started

diago acts as UAS(User Agent Server) and UAC(User Agent Client). For now it keeps abstractions only where it needs.


#### Setup diago:
```go
ua, _ := sipgo.NewUA()
transportUDP := diago.Transport{
	Transport: "udp",
	BindHost:  "127.0.0.1",
	BindPort:  5060,
}

transportTCP := diago.Transport{
	Transport: "tcp",
	BindHost:  "127.0.0.1",
	BindPort:  5060,
}

d := diago.NewDiago(ua,
	diago.WithTransport(transportUDP),
	diago.WithTransport(transportTCP),
)
```


#### Incoming call
```go
d.Serve(ctx, func(inDialog *diago.DialogServerSession) {
	// - Do your call routing.
	switch inDialog.ToUser() {
		case "answer":
		case "123456"
	}
})
```

#### Outgoing

```go
dialog, err := d.Dial(ctx, recipient sip.Uri, bridge *Bridge, opts sipgo.AnswerOptions)
dialog.Hangup()
```

## Answering call

```go
func Answer(inDialog *diago.DialogServerSession) {
	inDialog.Progress() // Progress -> 100 Trying
	inDialog.Ringing()  // Ringing -> 180 Response

	if err := inDialog.Answer(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Failed to answer", err)
		return
	}

	ctx := inDialog.Context()
	select {
	case <-ctx.Done():
	case <-time.After(1 * time.Minute):
	}
}
```

## Playing file with Playback

Playing file is done by playback. 

Supported formats:
- wav (PCM)

```go
func Playback(inDialog *diago.DialogServerSession) {
	inDialog.Ringing()

	playfile, err := os.Open("demo-instruct.wav")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Failed to open file", err)
		return
	}

	pb, err := inDialog.PlaybackCreate()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Failed to create playback", err)
		return
	}

	if err := inDialog.Answer(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Failed to answer", err)
		return
	}

	if err := pb.Play(playfile, "audio/wav"); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Playing failed", err)
	}
}
```

### Playback with control 

For more controling over audio playback
```go 
pb, err := inDialog.PlaybackControlCreate()

pb.Mute(true) // Mute call
pb.Mute(false) // Unmute call 
```

## Proxy media 

Accessing media (audio payload) for custom processing or proxying. 
This is something you will use for **Speech to Text**.

```go 
func ProxyMedia(inDialog *diago.DialogServerSession) {
	inDialog.Progress() // Progress -> 100 Trying
	inDialog.Ringing()  // Ringing -> 180 Response
	inDialog.Answer()   // Answqer -> 200 Response

	lastPrint := time.Now()
	pktsCount := 0
	buf := make([]byte, media.RTPBufSize)
	for {
		n, err := inDialog.Media().Read(buf)
		if err != nil {
			return
		}
        // Access to RTP Header If needed
        rtpHeader := inDialog.Media().RTPPacketReader.PacketHeader

        // Get Audio payload. Decode it, send to THIRD PARTY
        audioEncoded := buf[:n]

        pktsCount++
	}
}
```
# Bridging calls (B2BUA)

**Bridge** is entity that needs to be created before media can be bridged.

Normally you need to Dial + Bridge, but there is helper for this called `DialBridge()`

Example:
```go
var recipient = sip.Uri{User: "test", Host: "127.0.0.1", Port: 5090}

func BridgeCall(inDialog *diago.DialogServerSession) {
	inDialog.Progress() // Progress -> 100 Trying
	inDialog.Ringing()  // Ringing -> 180 Response
	inDialog.Answer()

	bridge := diago.NewBridge()
	// Add our leg into bridge
	if err := bridge.AddDialogSession(inDialog); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Failed to add inDialog session", err)
		return
	}

	outDialog, err := d.DialBridge(ctx, , &bridge, sipgo.AnswerOptions{})
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Failed to dial", err)
		return
	}
	defer outDialog.Close() // Always close, not have media hanging

	outCtx := outDialog.Context()
	defer func() {
		if err := outDialog.Hangup(outCtx); err != nil {
			fmt.Println("Failed to hangup", err)
		}
	}()

	// Wait for hangup of one of dialogs
	select {
	case <-inCtx.Done():
	case <-outCtx.Done():
	}
}

```


# Advanced

## Access SIP headers

```go
req := inDialog.InviteRequest
xheader := req.GetHeader("X-My-Header").Value()
```


## Access Media Session (SDP)

```go
sess := inDialog.Media().MediaSession

for _, s := range sess.Formats {
	fmt.Println(s) // ulaw, alaw
}
```
